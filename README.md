## 🛡️ Data Privacy

This project uses publicly available, de-identified datasets — including the **Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Obesity: Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)**, the **COVID-19 Healthy Diet Dataset**, the **Sugar-Sweetened Beverage Consumption in California Residents** dataset, and the **What We Eat in America (WWEIA) Database** — as part of the training data for an AI chatbot focused on general health and wellness information.  

These datasets contain **only aggregated or non-personally identifiable data** and **do not include Protected Health Information (PHI)** as defined under the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Therefore, the data used for model training **fall outside HIPAA’s regulatory scope**.  

All data are used in compliance with their respective **open data licenses**:  
- [Open Data Commons Open Database License (ODbL 1.0)](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/1-0/)  
- [Kaggle Dataset License](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mariaren/covid19-healthy-diet-dataset/data)  

The chatbot does not process, store, or generate outputs based on individual health records, and no attempt is made to re-identify or link data to specific individuals.
